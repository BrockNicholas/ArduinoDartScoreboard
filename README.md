# ArduinoDartScoreboard

This was a hobby project I designed from scratch. It's a little controller and display for calculating darts scores for two players. The pinout can be seen in `Pinout.png`


The Arduino pins can be remapped in `Darts/Config.cpp`


## Components Needed
1. Arduino Uno
2. Parallax 2-Axis Joystick (Or two potentiomenters)
3. Breadboard
4. I2C LCD
5. Jumper wires (Male-Male and Male-Female)
6. Three two-pin buttons
